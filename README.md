# 👋 Hi, I'm Marwane

I'm diving into the world of **Data Science**, **Data Analysis**, and **Machine Learning**, learning through hands on projects, real world challenges, and lots of trial and error.

## 💡 What I’m About

Not an expert (yet!), but I am passionate about using data and AI to explore and solve real-world problems.

Alongside data, I have a deep love for **languages and cultures**. I speak:
- 🇪🇸 Spanish  
- 🇸🇦 Arabic  
- 🇬🇧 English  
- 🇫🇷 French  
- 🇮🇹 Italian  
- 🇯🇵 Japanese  
- 🇩🇪 German  
*(in order of fluency)*

## 📌 Projects & Practice
I'm actively sharing my learning journey through public notebooks on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marwanehosni), where I experiment with real-world datasets, practice feature engineering, and improve my modeling skills — one project at a time.

### 🥉 Medal-Winning Work 
- 🧪 **[Predicting Optimal Fertilizers](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marwanehosni/predicting-opt-fertilizers-eda-fe-and-modeling)**  
  Notebook submission for Kaggle competition: EDA + Feature Engineering + Modeling for agritech applications  

### 📊 Recent Notebooks
- 👩‍💻 **[TelCo Churn Prediction & Retention](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marwanehosni/telco-customer-churn-prediction-retention)**  
  Synthetic messy data cleaning and churn modeling  

- 💸 **[Unified Payments Interface (UPI) – EDA & Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marwanehosni/unified-payments-interface-eda-modeling)**  
  Exploratory analysis on India’s real-time payment system

## 🌍 Why I Do This
My goal is to grow into someone who can **build useful tools* while also **connecting both worlds of AI and Language Learning**. I believe in learning by doing and sharing my process as I go.

Thanks for stopping by. ☺️
